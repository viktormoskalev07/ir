          <h3>It all starts with empathy</h3>
          <p>
            Technology is woven into our lives, with the purpose of assisting us. Yet it’s designed to be utilitarian in value, without a genuine relationship being formed. To truly deliver on our need for connection and drive deep engagement, technology needs the ability to project empathy.

          <p>
            After years of research and user studies combining psychology, behavioral sciences, and advanced cognitive AI capabilities, we built the first-ever empathetic digital companion agent — one that delivers on our needs, while projecting empathy to deliver engagement, trust, and collaboration between the agent and the user.
