          ElliQ supports older adults’ independence, providing them with social companionship, wellness activities, connection to various care circles (i.e. family members and caregivers), and the ability to take charge of their health. ElliQ also tracks patients’ activity within the home, and offers a direct channel of communication between the primary care provider and the patient.
